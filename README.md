# Elastic-SIEM

Elastic Stack SIEM Home Lab
Project Overview

Welcome to the Elastic Stack SIEM Home Lab project! This endeavor aimed to configure and manage an Elastic Stack SIEM environment in a home lab setting. By deploying various cybersecurity tools and simulating security events, I sought to enhance my skills in network security monitoring and threat detection. Here's a breakdown of our key achievements:

Project Highlights
1. Elastic Stack SIEM Configuration and Management

    Set up and configured Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment.
    Deployed a Kali Linux VM and configured Elastic Agents for log collection.
    Forwarded data to the SIEM for effective security event monitoring.

2. Security Event Simulation and Analysis

    Generated and analyzed security events using Nmap on Kali Linux.
    Gained hands-on experience in simulating and assessing potential threats.

3. Visualization and Alerting in SIEM

    Developed a custom dashboard in Elastic SIEM to visualize security events.
    Showcased expertise in data interpretation and pattern recognition.
    Created and tested alert rules for detecting specific security events.
